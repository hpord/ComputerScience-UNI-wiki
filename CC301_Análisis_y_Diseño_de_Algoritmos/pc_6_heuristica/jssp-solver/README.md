# Job Shop Scheduling Problem Solver
----------

Population Based Metaheuristics approaches for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.

Project presentation at:
doc/Job Shop Scheduling Problem – Population Based Metaheuristics

----------

The proposed method combines:

- The Population Policy Control from:

   [1] Gonçalves, J. F., Resende, M. G. C., 2013. An extended akers graphical
   method with a biased random-key genetic algorithm for job-shop scheduling. 
   International Transactions in Operational Research.

- The Path Relink Crossover from:
 
   [2] Bo Peng, Zhipeng Lu, T.C.E. Cheng, 2014,
   A Tabu Search/Path Relinking Algorithm to Solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.

- The Critical Path Destruction Neighborhoods ideas (and the Tabu Search implementation) from:

   [3] Balas, E., Vazacopoulos, A., 1998. Guided local search with shifting bottle
   neck for job shop scheduling. Management Science 44 (2), 262–275.

   job shop problem. Journal of Scheduling 8, 145–159.
