- Break even makespan
 - no improve
- Ranking moves based on critical path
 - no improve

- Dynamic Tabu List Size?
 - no improve
 
- Stop Criterion
	A/B strategy?

- Decrease amount of dynamic memory use

===================
Ideas
Can a upper bound of the makespan be used to accelerate the local search? 

MH

1 - Generate Initial Solutions Population (active scheduling generaton)
	- every generated solutions receive a ls improve.
	- can use distance parameter here?

2 - 

Add test to check for optimal point.

select pair biased by distance.

Keep infeasible solutions in the population?

Methods to keep variability in population (high inner distances). 

Remove duplicate solutions.

==========================
Current setting:

Population size: 150
Few generations
Few elite and mutation
Procedure repetition: 10
Small tabu list.
